# dblp-extractor

This project is aim to be an extractor to search dblp data. DBLP is an open bibliographic 
information on major computer science journals and proceedings.

## File arrangement

* _config_:  you can find a "config_example.yaml"; is an example how looks the real
config, and which parameters of there are mandatory.

* _data_: is where all raw data is expected. There is a _data_example.xml_ looks
like dblp xml file, but has only a few items. To replicate all project should download the
original xml: https://dblp.org/xml/release/ .

* _database_: there is the DDL file and the repositories to interact with the database. Also, 
there is the class to connect with the database.

* _extractor_: here is placed the classes and modules needed to interact between the xml raw
data and database.

* _model_: where all models are placed.

## Set Up
1. Install project dependencies; in the root project there is the _requirements.txt_:

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Copy or rename *config_example.yaml* to *config.yaml*, this file is added into .gitignore
file to avoid push sensible data. Modify this file with the database configuration. If *db*
name (now *metascience*) is changed; should be changed in ddl file as well.
3. Execute *setup.py*; in the first time you should add at least --ddl and --xml arguments:
   1. --ddl argument is for ddl file.
   2. --xml argument is for xml file.
   3. --splitXml needs a xml file and splits this file by first level xml children.
   4. --insert needs a xml file and is aim to insert all xml data into database.

This is to only creates database:
```console
python extractor/setup.py --ddl "../database/mariadbDDL.sql" --xml "../data/data_example.xml"
```

This is to create and insert database: 
```console
python extractor/setup.py --ddl "../database/mariadbDDL.sql" --xml "../data/data_example.xml --insert True"
```
This is to split the xml:
```console
python extractor/setup.py  --xml "../data/data_example.xml --splitXml True"
```

If the four parameters are applied, the inserts are from original xml, and not for 
the new generated by the split.
